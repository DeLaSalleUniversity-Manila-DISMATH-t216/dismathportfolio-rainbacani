##Week 1
 - Introduction to Dicrete Mathematics DISMATH: First thing in mind: "This term would be great because of DISMATH."
- That warm up problem about the knaves and knights was mind-blowing (it was crazy).
- I wonder who invented and started the study of discrete mathematics.
- No matter how I want to punch in the face, still, it's genius.
- Dismath only cares about mathematical truth and not other truths such us scientific and authoritative.
- Which is somehow reasonable because even authoritave and scientific people lie. 
- Mathematics never does so.
- I knew the word "proposition" in my english subject. 
- I never knew it can be so tricky when I encountered it in DISMATH.
- Proposition can be either true or false. 
- Which makes declarative sentences a proposition and imperative sentences not.
- DISMATH is like learning a whole new language especially when I saw unfamiliar things like ¬(not), ^(and), ∧(and), v(or),⊕ (ex or), →(implies to), and ↔(biconditional).
- Through proof table we proved that implication is equal to its contrapositive.
- p → q = ¬q → ¬p
- At first I was like "What are those!?". 
- But I realized they can be useful in any argument anytime soon

#Week 2
- DISMATH is starting to affect the way I talk to people.
- This week, I learned that propositions can also be proved using Logical equivalences.
- Now it gets a bit familiar. 
- I can remember those identity laws in trigonometry.
- In DISMATH, there are also laws that we can use as a logical proof, such as
|         Name        |                           Equivalence                          |
38	|:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
39	|    Identity laws    |                      p ∧ T ≡ p<br>p v F ≡ p               |
40	|   Domination laws   |                       p v T ≡ T<br>p ∧ F ≡ F               |
41	|    Negation laws    |                     p v ¬p ≡ T<br>p ∧ ¬p ≡ F                   |
42	| Double negation law |                            ¬(¬p) ≡ p                           |
43	|   Idempotent laws   |                       p v p ≡ p<br>p ∧ p ≡ p               |
44	|   Commutative laws  |                   p v q ≡ q v p<br>p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p               |
45	|   Associative laws  |       (p v q) v r ≡ p v (q v r)<br>(p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r)   |
46	|  Distributive laws  | p v (q ∧ r) ≡ (p v q) ∧ (p v r)<br>p ∧(q v r) ≡ (p ∧ q) v (p ∧ r) |
47	|   De Morgan's laws  |              ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p v ¬q<br>¬(p v q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q      |    |
48	|   Absorption laws   |                 p v (p ∧ q) ≡ p<br>p ∧ (p v q) ≡ p          |   |
