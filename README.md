##Week 1
 - Introduction to Dicrete Mathematics DISMATH: First thing in mind: "This term would be great because of DISMATH."
- That warm up problem about the knaves and knights was mind-blowing (it was crazy).
- I wonder who invented and started the study of discrete mathematics.
- No matter how I want to punch in the face, still, it's genius.
- Dismath only cares about mathematical truth and not other truths such us scientific and authoritative.
- Which is somehow reasonable because even authoritave and scientific people lie. 
- Mathematics never does so.
- I knew the word "proposition" in my english subject. 
- I never knew it can be so tricky when I encountered it in DISMATH.
- Proposition can be either true or false. 
- Which makes declarative sentences a proposition and imperative sentences not.
- DISMATH is like learning a whole new language especially when I saw unfamiliar things like ¬(not), ^(and), ∧(and), v(or),⊕ (ex or), →(implies to), and ↔(biconditional).
- Through proof table we proved that implication is equal to its contrapositive.
- p → q = ¬q → ¬p

#Week 2
- DISMATH is starting to affect the way I talk to people.
- This week, I learned that propositions can also be proved using Logical equivalences.
-Using logical equivalences is similar to identity laws in trigonometry.
- In DISMATH, there are also laws that we can use as a logical proof, such as:

|         Name        |                           Equivalence                          |	
|:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    Identity laws    |                      p ∧ T ≡ p<br>p v F ≡ p               |
|   Domination laws   |                       p v T ≡ T<br>p ∧ F ≡ F               |
|    Negation laws    |                     p v ¬p ≡ T<br>p ∧ ¬p ≡ F                   |
| Double negation law |                            ¬(¬p) ≡ p                           |
|   Idempotent laws   |                       p v p ≡ p<br>p ∧ p ≡ p               |
|   Commutative laws  |                   p v q ≡ q v p<br>p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p               |
|   Associative laws  |       (p v q) v r ≡ p v (q v r)<br>(p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r)   |
|  Distributive laws  | p v (q ∧ r) ≡ (p v q) ∧ (p v r)<br>p ∧(q v r) ≡ (p ∧ q) v (p ∧ r) |
|   De Morgan's laws  |              ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p v ¬q<br>¬(p v q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q      |    |
|   Absorption laws   |                 p v (p ∧ q) ≡ p<br>p ∧ (p v q) ≡ p          |   |

-Another lesson I learned was **Quantifiers**
-Quantifiers indicates generality of the open sentence in which a variable occurs.
--**Existential Quantifiers** indicates "there exists".
--**Universal Quantifiers** indicates "for all".
-**When is it true? When is it false?**:

|               |           When True             |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|     ∀xP(x)    |    P(x) is true for every x    |
|     ∃xP(x)   |   There is an x for which P(x) is true  |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|               |           When False             |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------:|
|     ∀xP(x)    |    There is an x for which P(x) is false   |
|     ∃xP(x)   |   P(x) is false for every x   |
