##Week 1
 - Introduction to Dicrete Mathematics DISMATH: First thing in mind: "This term would be great because of DISMATH."
- That warm up problem about the knaves and knights was mind-blowing (it was crazy).
- I wonder who invented and started the study of discrete mathematics.
- No matter how I want to punch in the face, still, it's genius.
- Dismath only cares about mathematical truth and not other truths such us scientific and authoritative.
- Which is somehow reasonable because even authoritave and scientific people lie. 
- Mathematics never does so.
- I knew the word "proposition" in my english subject. 
- I never knew it can be so tricky when I encountered it in DISMATH.
- Proposition can be either true or false. 
- Which makes declarative sentences a proposition and imperative sentences not.
- DISMATH is like learning a whole new language especially when I saw unfamiliar things like ¬(not), ^(and), ∧(and), v(or),⊕ (ex or), →(implies to), and ↔(biconditional).
- Through proof table we proved that implication is equal to its contrapositive.
- p → q = ¬q → ¬p

#Week 2
- DISMATH is starting to affect the way I talk to people.
- This week, I learned that propositions can also be proved using Logical equivalences.
-Using logical equivalences is similar to identity laws in trigonometry.
- In DISMATH, there are also laws that we can use as a logical proof, such as

|         Name        |                           Equivalence                          |	
|:-------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    Identity laws    |                      p ∧ T ≡ p<br>p v F ≡ p               |
|   Domination laws   |                       p v T ≡ T<br>p ∧ F ≡ F               |
|    Negation laws    |                     p v ¬p ≡ T<br>p ∧ ¬p ≡ F                   |
| Double negation law |                            ¬(¬p) ≡ p                           |
|   Idempotent laws   |                       p v p ≡ p<br>p ∧ p ≡ p               |
|   Commutative laws  |                   p v q ≡ q v p<br>p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p               |
|   Associative laws  |       (p v q) v r ≡ p v (q v r)<br>(p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r)   |
|  Distributive laws  | p v (q ∧ r) ≡ (p v q) ∧ (p v r)<br>p ∧(q v r) ≡ (p ∧ q) v (p ∧ r) |
|   De Morgan's laws  |              ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p v ¬q<br>¬(p v q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q      |    |
|   Absorption laws   |                 p v (p ∧ q) ≡ p<br>p ∧ (p v q) ≡ p          |   |

-Another lesson I learned was **Quantifiers**
-Quantifiers indicates generality of the open sentence in which a variable occurs.
--**Existential Quantifiers** indicates "there exists".
--**Universal Quantifiers** indicates "for all".
-**When is it true? When is it false?**
|               |           When True             |
|     ∀xP(x)    |    P(x) is true for every x    |
|     ∃xP(x)   |   There is an x for which P(x) is true  |
|               |           When False             |
|     ∀xP(x)    |    There is an x for which P(x) is false   |
|     ∃xP(x)   |   P(x) is false for every x   |


-I also learned this week about **Predicate Logic**
- **Predicate logic** concerned its internal structure in terms of *subject* and *predicate*.
-Lastly, I've learned the terminologies for Rules of Inference:
-Argument - a sequence of statements that ends with a conclusion.
-Ex. (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ... ∧ pn) → q
--Where (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ... ∧ pn) are the premises and q is the conclusion
-Valid - The conclusion of he argument must follow from the true of the preceding statements of the argument.
-Ex. (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ p3 ... ∧ pn) → q is TAUTOLOGY
-Tautology- A statement is ALWAYS true
-Fallacy - Invalid argument.

#Week 3
There are **tools** that can be valid argumaents in propositional logic.
  - Truth Table (for less variables)
  - Logical equivalences
  - Quantifiers
  - Rules of Inference
-It is now clear to me that the validity of the argument is different from the thruthfulness of a conlusion.
-Validity focuses on the structure, while the truthfulness of the conlusion is guranteed if all the premises are true. 
- Because some arguments have more than two variables, using rules of inference instead of truth tables would help.
- We can use **rules of inference** as an alternative, the table is shown below:

|   **Rule of Inference**  |            **Tautology**           |          **Name**          |
|:--------------------|:------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
|       p<br>p→q<br>∴ q      |        (p ∧ (p → q)) → q       |      Modus Ponens      |
|     ¬q<br>p→q<br>∴ ¬p     |       (¬q ∧ (p → q)) → ¬p      |      Modus Tollens     |
|     p→q<br>q→r<br>∴ p→r    |  ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → (p → r) | Hypothetical Syllogism |
|      p∨q<br>¬p<br>∴ q      |       ((p ∨ q) ∧ ¬p) → q       |  Disjunctive Syllogism |
|       p<br>∴p ∨ q       |           p → (p ∨ q)          |        Addition        |
|       p ∧ q<br>∴ p       |           (p ∧ q) → p          |      Simplication      |
|      p<br>q<br>∴ p ∧ q     |      ((p) ∧ (q)) → (p ∧ q)     |       Conjunction      |
| p ∨ q<br>¬p ∨ r<br>∴ q ∨ r | ((p ∨ q) ∧ (¬p ∨ r)) → (q ∨ r) |       Resolution       |
